Establishing a sanitary landfill (SLF)is on the government’s topmost plan to curb the worsening issue of improper garbage disposal everywhere. 

Careful planning is necessary, and we came up with this primer to dispel any misconceptions about establishing an SLF in your community.

## What is a sanitary landfill and Why do we need it??

A sanitary landfill (SLF) is a safe site for communities to dump their wastes so they don’t end up in farmlands and oceans.

Wastes dumped in sanitary landfills are generally harmful to the environment, and third-world countries do not have the means to isolate them until they are safe. Having an environmentally-sound place to put all these chemical and hazardous wastes ensures public health and safety for our food-production areas and seas.

## What are the requirements for establishing a sanitary landfill?

Here are some of the top requirements that every LGU and community should know before establishing a sanitary landfill. 

1. Sound engineering and preparation

Undertake a proper environmental investigation and community involvement before establishing a sanitary landfill. This includes community organizing and consultation. 

However, more than the community itself, the location of the sanitary landfill is of utmost importance. These locations are not suitable for establishing a sanitary landfill – a flood-prone area near a wetland, a fault zone with high-risk earthquakes, sites with unstable soil foundations, and near airports. 

Scientific investigations such as test drilling to understand what’s going on under the soil. It should not drain into any surface water or has shallow groundwater.   

Aside from the landfill itself, it is important to include treatment facilities to prevent pollutants from reaching the soil and groundwater. This consists of a waste retaining facility, stormwater drainage facility, leachate collection facility, leachate treatment facility, and gas venting facility.

2. Impermeable liner to prevent leachate from reaching the soil and groundwater

There are different types of liners, both synthetic and natural. The bottom line for these liners is impermeability. A higher-capacity sanitary landfill needs synthetic and natural liners to ensure that leachate doesn’t end up in the groundwater. 

Compacted Clay Liner (CCL) is the primary choice for natural liners. It must have a permeability of 10-5 cm/sec based on Philippine standards. It should also be at least 60cm thick in Category 1 and 2 sanitary landfills and at least 75cm in Category 3 SLFs. 

On the other hand, synthetic liners consist of polyethylene, antioxidants, heat stabilizers, and carbon black. In Philippine standards, it should be HDPE and at least 1.5mm thick with a permeability of 10-6 cm/sec.

3. Continued control and monitoring

Constant monitoring after the operation starts is essential. These are the parameters that need monitoring: 

Leachate quality and quantity
Groundwater quality
Landfill gases
Offensive odor
Noise and vibration
Vectors and scattering wastes


4. Planned waste placement and layering

There are different methods of landfilling that SLF operators can take on. Mostly, it depends on the type of soil makeup to determine the type of SLF to construct. However, to ease up the decomposition and soil stabilization process, every layer of waste needs compacting and adding a soil layer. 

Adding daily cover (at least 6 inches) also ensures lesser odor and pests that act as vectors. It also keeps the waste inside the SLF with no issues of scattering waste, especially plastic, into the SLF’s environs. It also acts as a fire breaker in case of spontaneous combustion from methane gases.

However, the daily cover does not need to be soil always. Landfilled wastes (3-6 months) is also a good alternative, especially if you use the area method of dumping. 

What happens to the area after the sanitary landfill is filled?
When the landfill is full, it will be closed to public use. However, closing it to public use only means more monitoring. The decomposition process continues underneath. Therefore, there are more leachates, gases released, and odors. 

The Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) mandates at least 15 years of post-closure management. This includes monitoring waste layer stabilization, ground settlement, and final cover and landscaping, among other things.


## Can you develop the area previously used as a sanitary landfill?

Yes, it can be developed for low-density and low-rise buildings. Hong Kong 1 developed a closed SLF into a playground, archery field, lawn tennis, and basketball courts. 

Another closed SLF became a car racing circuit, greenhouse, and an education center after restoration. However, take caution when developing after closing an SLF. Conduct proper studies on soil stability and other engineering requirements before starting to develop the area.
